## FAQ

#### Why don't I see more game modes?

You will see the stats for the game modes you played that week ONLY. You will not see stats for game modes you did not play that week.

#### Why does it not show any stats for my account?

This is not a bot issue this is a API issue some accounts will give data back and some accounts will not. 

#### Why do some game mode names show blank?
This bot focuses on the core game modes that have been around such as resurgence, caldera, and now fortunes keep. If they do add a alternate game mode to each of those modes it will show a blank but I am working on adding more modes to the bot so you are able to see what mode those stats are coming from.
